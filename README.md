# Bachelor Thesis project - 2048 solver
This repository contains the code for my 2048-solver, which uses a reverse shielding architecture. Also see my bachelor thesis at kimas.dev/thesis.

# Running
Install requirements using requirements.txt. This code will only work UNIX based systems.
Three agents are made available. <br>
The greedy agent can be run by running `python play_random.py` <br>
The naive agent can be run by running `python play_naive.py`. <br>
The reverse shielded agent can be run by running `python play_tf.py` <br>
Further, a random policy player is provided, in `play_randompolicy.py`.
